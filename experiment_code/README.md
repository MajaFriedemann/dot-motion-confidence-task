Dot Motion Confidence Task
======

Adapted from Bang & Fleming 

1. Run training.py (once on a pre-TUS day; longer instructions, gives feedback, has super simple trials).
2. Run staircase.py (once on a pre-TUS day; staircase task difficulty and save the staircased values for the participant to be loaded when running main.py).
3. Run main.py (on TUS day; v short reminder of instructions).



Maja to do:
- Finish main.py data saving and ending instructions
- Make training.py with longer instructions, easy trials, and feedback
- Make staircase.py, staircasing coherences and distances
- Maybe figure out how to make dot stimulus according to Dan's version
